This is my first GitHub account for Wake Tech Community College

My first repository name is AProxy.github.io 

I downloaded the desktop version from the link provided in the assignment, then I logged in and found the clone repository option and clicked on the my only available repository and cloned a copy on my machine with its own folder in my document files.
